        <p>Hello there! Here a quick glimpes of me.
            Currently a thrid year Communication and Elctronics Enginnering bacholor student in the university of Arab Academy for Science, Technology & Maritime Transport, Smart Village Campus,Egypt:
            I have a passion of software enginnering ,hence I'm starting to take this passion to the next level by taking courses in Flutter and as of right now Frontend Enginnering in the ALX programme.
            Hopefully once I'm done I'll join the backend programme to become a fullstack software enginner.

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I began my academic journey as an IGCSE student with a strong foundation in various subjects, particularly excelling in coding and programming languages such as MATLAB, Octave, and Python. This proficiency has been instrumental in my transition to becoming a student of Electronics and Communication Engineering.

            In my current academic pursuit, I am delving deeper into the realms of electronics and communication systems. I am acquiring skills in circuit design, signal processing, telecommunications, and microelectronics, among others. These studies not only build upon my coding abilities but also broaden my understanding of how technology enables communication and connectivity in today's world.
            
            Beyond academics, I have maintained a passion for the arts, with interests in art, painting, and playing the piano. My artistic endeavors continue to provide a creative outlet and enhance my ability to think critically and innovatively in both technical and non-technical contexts.
            
            As I progress in my studies and explore opportunities in Electronics and Communication Engineering, I am eager to apply my diverse skill set to contribute meaningfully to technological advancements and innovations in communication systems./p>
